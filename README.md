# GDP-Analysis-and-Prediction
This is a project on the analysis and prediction of GDP. This repository contains the dataset used in this model and python notebook files containing the code to train & test the various Machine Learning models. Implemented various machine learning regression algorithms (i.e. logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, decision trees, support vector machines, random forest and gradient boosted decision trees) to find out the best model that fits the dataset. A Web Application User Interface is made to input the parameters in order to predict the GDP.
